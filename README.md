## Project Description/Outline:
Exploring Real Estate Trends within the top 5 cities in the US based on population. We will look at the historical trends of the housing market, compare the rental and buying markets, and compare the city’s housing markets against each other.

## Questions to answer:
* Which Property Types are more Popular?
* Is it more costly to rent or buy?
* How much has property inventory changed over time? 
* Which city has the shortest turnover rate of inventory?

## Datasets to Be Used:
* https://www.kaggle.com/zillow/zecon
* https://www.zillow.com/research/data/

## Rough Breakdown of Tasks:
* Clean Data
* Pull Data and filter out the different property types for the top 5 cities.
* Determine which 5 US cities are the most populous as of 2020.
* Analyze the different types of properties in those 5 cities (ie. Single family home, condo, etc…)
* Analyze market trends in the rental market for the 5 cities over time
* Analyze market trends in the buyers’ market for the 5 cities over time
* Compare all 5 cities to see their inventory turnover rate (how long between when a property is put on the market and when it is sold/leased.)
