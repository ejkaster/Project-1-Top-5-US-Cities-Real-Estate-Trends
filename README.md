## Project Description/Outline:
Exploring Adult Beverage Receipt Trends in the Greater Houston Area. 
We will look at the Liqour, Wine, and Beer sales in Houston and its 
surrounding areas (Katy, League City, Pasadena, Pearland, Sugar Land, and Cypress).

## Questions to answer:
* Which alcoholic beverage (liquor, wine, beer) is the most popular in the top cities in the greater Houston area?
* What it average receipt sales per beverage per city?
* What is the percentage breakdown of beverage types with the highest total receipts by Houston Area?
* Is there a correlation between locations that charge a cover and their sales?

## Dataset to Be Used:
https://data.texas.gov/Government-and-Taxes/Mixed-Beverage-Gross-Receipts/naix-2893/data

## Rough Breakdown of Tasks:
* Pull  and Clean Data, then sort by Houston Area
* Make a bar chart to compare the total sales receipt volume by Houston Area
* Make a bar chart to compare the mean of the sales receipts for each Houston Area
* Make a pie chart of the different beverage sales percentage by Houston Area
* Make a scatter plot with sale receipts in the x-axis and cover charge receipts in the y-axis. Draw a regression line and find the correlation coefficient.
